## Overview

Apps and third-party SDKs — distributed as XCFrameworks, Swift packages, or Xcode projects — can contain a privacy manifest file, named `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`. The privacy manifest is a property list that records the following information:

- The types of data collected by your app or third-party SDK. You need to provide this information for your app or third-party SDK on all platforms.
- The required reasons APIs your app or third-party SDK uses. You need to provide this information for your app or third-party SDK on iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS.

For each type of data your app or third-party SDK collects and category of required reasons API it uses, the app or third-party SDK needs to record the reasons in its bundled privacy manifest file.

> **Important:** You need to include a privacy manifest file in your third-party SDK if it’s listed in “SDKs that require a privacy manifest and signature,” in [Upcoming third-party SDK requirements](https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements/). Otherwise, include a privacy manifest file in your third-party SDK if it uses a required reasons API, collects data about the person using apps that include the third-party SDK, enables the app to collect data about people using the app, or contacts tracking domains. Providing a privacy manifest file helps app developers understand the API use and data-collection practices of your third-party SDK.

For information on editing the privacy manifest file, see [Editing property list files](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/editing-property-list-files).
