# Target API level requirements for Google Play apps

Starting August 31, 2026:

- New apps and app updates must target Android 16 (API level 36) or higher to be submitted to Google Play; except for Wear OS, and Android Automotive OS apps, which must target Android 15 (API level 35) or higher, and Android TV and Android XR apps, which must target Android 14 (API level 34) or higher.
- Existing apps must target Android 15 (API level 35) or higher to remain available to new users on devices running Android OS higher than your app’s target API level. Apps that target Android 14 (API level 34) or lower, including Android 13 (API level 33) or lower for Wear OS and Android TV, and Android XR, and Android 12 (API level 31) or lower for Android Automotive OS will only be available on devices running Android OS that are the same or lower than your apps’ target API level.

You will be able to request an extension to November 1, 2026if you need more time to update your app. You'll be able to access your app's extension forms in Play Console later this year.

Every new Android version introduces changes that enhance the user experience, security, and performance of the Android platform overall. Each app specifies a `targetSdkVersion` (also known as the target API level) in the manifest file. The target API level indicates how your app is meant to run on different Android versions.

Configuring your app to target a recent API level ensures that users benefit from security, privacy, and performance improvements, while still allowing an app to run on older Android versions (down to the specified `minSdkVersion`).

To provide Android and Google Play users with a safe experience, Google Play requires all apps to meet target API level requirements listed below.

Exceptions to these requirements include the following:

- [Permanently private apps](https://support.google.com/googleplay/work/answer/9563481) that are restricted to users in a specific organization and intended for internal distribution only.

## Definitions

| **New app** | An app that is not yet published on Google Play (that is, a brand new app). |
| --- | --- |
| **Existing app** | An app that is published on Google Play. |
| **App update** | A new version of the app that you’re submitting for review to replace your existing app. |

## App update requirements

| **Android OS version  (API level)** | **When are new app and app update submissions required to target this API level?** |  |
| --- | --- | --- |

*Developers will be able to request an extension to November 1, 2026.

### App availability requirements

Currently, existing apps (across mobile and Android Auto) must target Android 15 (API level 35) or higher by August 31, 2026, including Android 14 (API level 34) or higher for Wear OS, Android 13 (API level 33) or higher for Android TV, Android 14 (API level 34) or higher for Android XR, and Android 12L (API Level 32) or higher for Android Automotive OS. Otherwise, they will stop being discoverable to all Google Play users whose devices run Android OS versions newer than your app’s target API level, as your app wasn’t built to meet the safety and quality standard that these users expect from newer Android OS versions.

**Developers will be able to request an extension to November 1, 2026. You'll be able to access your app's extension forms in Play Console later this year.*

## Frequently asked questions

### For apps targeting API 34 or below

## I have a live app on Google Play that targets API 34 or lower (for Wear OS, app targeting API 33 or lower), that I do not plan to update. What are my options?

If you don’t plan to update your app to the latest Target API level required, your app will not be available in Google Play store to new users on devices running Android OS newer than what your app targets. It will be available only to Google Play users with devices running Android OS with API level of your app or lower.

If you plan to update your app to a higher target API and need more time beyond August 31 2026, you may request an extension to continue distributing to all Google Play users until November 1 2026. An extension form will be available later this year in the Play Developer Console.

If you want to stop serving your app to new users even on older devices, you can [unpublish your app](https://www.support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859350).

## Where can I find the extension form to continue distributing to all Google Play users until November 1, 2026?

Only apps that are not compliant with the policy will receive a policy warnings and notification in Play Console. The extension form is available through the details page of the warning or issue on the

Policy status

page in Play Console.

## I have apps that I no longer want published on Google Play. What can I do?

Please refer to

this Help Center article

for instructions on how to unpublish your app.

## How will my users who already downloaded my app previously be impacted?

Users who have previously installed the app from Google Play will not be impacted and will still be able to discover, re-install, and use the app on any Android OS version that your app supports.

## Will this update impact app downloads?

It may impact your app download levels if new users on devices with newer Android OS versions cannot discover or download your app from Google Play.

## What will the user experience be if a user on a newer device visits a deep link to the app store page, but the app is targeting API 34 or lower?

Google Play will inform the user that “this app is not available to install on their device because it was made for an older version of Android.”. The illustration mock below (actual design of store and device notifications may differ) helps you visualize how this will look to Google Play users.

## Are there any exceptions for existing apps targeting API 34 or below?

Yes. We provide exceptions for [permanently private apps](https://support.google.com/googleplay/work/answer/9563481) that are restricted to users in a specific organization and intended for internal distribution only.
